#    Drop(Color)
#        These values will be multiplied by the drop percentages of the items
#        for creatures to determine which items to drop. All default to 1.
#        To allow you better control of drops, separate multipliers have been
#        created for items of each quality group.
#
#    DropMoney
#        This value will be multiplied by any gold looted and pickpocketed.
#        Default: 1
