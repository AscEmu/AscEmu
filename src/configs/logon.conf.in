#    LogonDatabase.Host        - The hostname that the database is located on
#    LogonDatabase.Username    - The username used for the mysql connection

#    LogonDatabase.Name        - The database name

# Host Directive
#
#    This is the address that the logonserver will listen on.
#    For example, "8.8.8.8" would allow only clients from 8.8.8.8 address to
#    connect to the logonserver, while other addresses would get
#    'Unable to Connect'.
#    To listen on all addresses, set it to 0.0.0.0
#    Default: 0.0.0.0
#
#    ISHost is the interserver communication listener. You need to enter the
#    address of your worldserver here or the logonserver will not listen to it.
#    To listen on all addresses, set it to 0.0.0.0
#    Default: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
#

<Listen Host          = "0.0.0.0"

# Server file logging level
#
#    MinimumMessageType
#        This directive controls how much output the server will
#        write to console or log files. It cannot be disabled.
#        0 = Trace; 1 = Debug; 2 = Minor; 3= Major;
#        Default: 2 (Minor)
#

<Logger MinimumMessageType = "2">

# Account Refresh Time
#
#    This controls on which time interval accounts gets refreshed. (In seconds)
#    600 seconds = 10 minutes
#    300 seconds = 5 minutes
#    Default = 600
#

<Rates AccountRefresh = "600">

# WorldServer Setup
#
#    DisablePings
#        This directive controls whether logonserver handles pings sent by the
#        worldserver to check if the connection is still alive. It is best
#        to keep this enabled.
#        Default: 0 (enabled)
#
#    AllowedIPs
#        This directive controls which IP addresses are allowed to register
#        with the logonserver.
#        This section MUST be completed, otherwise all attempts to link your
#        servers will fail. These "Allowed" fields are a space-separated list
#        of CIDR-form IP addresses that are allowed to make server connections
#        to your logonserver, and register realms.
#        For example, everything in the 127.0.0.* range would be:
#        127.0.0.0/24, as 24 of the bits must match the 127.0.0.0
#
#        To allow a single IP,
#        1.3.3.7/32, would allow only 1.3.3.7 to connect as 32 of the bits
#        must match.
#
#        To allow multiple IPs,
#        1.0.0.0/8, would allow everything in the 1.*.*.* range to connect as
#        only the first 8 bits must match.
#
#        Also, "127.0.0.1/24 8.8.8.8/32" would allow connections only from
#        127.0.0.1 and 8.8.8.8 addresses.
#
#    AllowedModIPs
#        In the same form as AllowedIPs, these are the IPs that are allowed
#        to modify the database (adding bans, GMs, account permissions, etc)
#

<LogonServer DisablePings   = "0"
             AllowedIPs     = "127.0.0.1/24"
             AllowedModIPs  = "127.0.0.1/24">
